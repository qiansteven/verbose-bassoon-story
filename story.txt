Once upon a time there was a sentient bassoon that loved to talk. 
Each day, it would let out its deep baritone sound for anyone or anything
that would listen. The bassoon lived a happy life, but deep down, it longed
for friends to live in harmony with. 
So began the verbose bassoon's journey to find an ensemble...

As the bassoon walked through the jungle, he came upon a tiger who loved to listen.
While the bassoon talked in his deep voice, the tiger lazily rested with his palms
folded, listening closely. The tiger could not help smiling at his new friend,
and the bassoon could not believe he found such a friend in a tiger.

After a few minutes of bassoon's talking, along came a warthog named Bumbaa and a meerkat named Simon. They couldn't help but start singing. It wasn't long until the tiger joined in and the four of them had formed what would come to be the most famous band in all of the Pride Lands.

At last, the bassoon had found  afeeling of fulfillment that he never felt
before. Nothing made him happier than playing in his newly formed quartet
and traveling across the lands to perform for others. However, it wasn't long
before the bassoon's hunger continued to grow. Why stop at just the Pride
Lands? -he thought. To his surprise, his band members began to feel the same
way. The next day, they bought 4 one way tickets to New York City. Ready to 
risk it all for their next adventure...
