Once upon a time there was a sentient bassoon that loved to talk. 
Each day, it would let out its deep baritone sound for anyone or anything
that would listen. The bassoon lived a happy life, but deep down, it longed
for friends to live in harmony with. 
So began the verbose bassoon's journey to find an ensemble...

As the bassoon walked through the jungle, he came upon a tiger who loved to listen.
While the bassoon talked in his deep voice, the tiger lazily rested with his palms
folded, listening closely. The tiger could not help smiling at his new friend,
and the bassoon could not believe he found such a friend in a tiger.

After a few minutes of bassoon's talking, along came a warthog named Bumbaa and a meerkat named Simon. They couldn't help but start singing. It wasn't long until the tiger joined in and the four of them had formed what would come to be the most famous band in all of the Pride Lands.
